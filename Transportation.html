            Convention Centre. It's a fast way to travel longer distances within the city.
             4. Trains: Amsterdam has several train stations, with Amsterdam Centraal being the 
            main hub. Trains are a great way to explore other Dutch cities and regions, including 
            day trips to places like Haarlem, Utrecht, and Rotterdam.
